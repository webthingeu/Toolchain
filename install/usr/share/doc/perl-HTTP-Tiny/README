NAME
    HTTP::Tiny - A small, simple, correct HTTP/1.1 client

VERSION
    version 0.090

SYNOPSIS
        use HTTP::Tiny;

        my $response = HTTP::Tiny->new->get('http://example.com/');

        die "Failed!\n" unless $response->{success};

        print "$response->{status} $response->{reason}\n";

        while (my ($k, $v) = each %{$response->{headers}}) {
            for (ref $v eq 'ARRAY' ? @$v : $v) {
                print "$k: $_\n";
            }
        }

        print $response->{content} if length $response->{content};

DESCRIPTION
    This is a very simple HTTP/1.1 client, designed for doing simple
    requests without the overhead of a large framework like LWP::UserAgent.

    It is more correct and more complete than HTTP::Lite. It supports
    proxies and redirection. It also correctly resumes after EINTR.

    If IO::Socket::IP 0.25 or later is installed, HTTP::Tiny will use it
    instead of IO::Socket::INET for transparent support for both IPv4 and
    IPv6.

    Cookie support requires HTTP::CookieJar or an equivalent class.

METHODS
  new
        $http = HTTP::Tiny->new( %attributes );

    This constructor returns a new HTTP::Tiny object. Valid attributes
    include:

    *   "agent" â A user-agent string (defaults to 'HTTP-Tiny/$VERSION'). If
        "agent" â ends in a space character, the default user-agent string
        is appended.

    *   "cookie_jar" â An instance of HTTP::CookieJar â or equivalent class
        that supports the "add" and "cookie_header" methods

    *   "default_headers" â A hashref of default headers to apply to
        requests

    *   "local_address" â The local IP address to bind to

    *   "keep_alive" â Whether to reuse the last connection (if for the same
        scheme, host and port) (defaults to 1)

    *   "max_redirect" â Maximum number of redirects allowed (defaults to 5)

    *   "max_size" â Maximum response size in bytes (only when not using a
        data callback). If defined, requests with responses larger than this
        will return a 599 status code.

    *   "http_proxy" â URL of a proxy server to use for HTTP connections
        (default is $ENV{http_proxy} â if set)

    *   "https_proxy" â URL of a proxy server to use for HTTPS connections
        (default is $ENV{https_proxy} â if set)

    *   "proxy" â URL of a generic proxy server for both HTTP and HTTPS
        connections (default is $ENV{all_proxy} â if set)

    *   "no_proxy" â List of domain suffixes that should not be proxied.
        Must be a comma-separated string or an array reference. (default is
        $ENV{no_proxy} â)

    *   "timeout" â Request timeout in seconds (default is 60) If a socket
        open, read or write takes longer than the timeout, the request
        response status code will be 599.

    *   "verify_SSL" â A boolean that indicates whether to validate the
        TLS/SSL certificate of an "https" â connection (default is true).
        Changed from false to true in version 0.083.

    *   "SSL_options" â A hashref of "SSL_*" â options to pass through to
        IO::Socket::SSL

    *   $ENV{PERL_HTTP_TINY_SSL_INSECURE_BY_DEFAULT} - Changes the default
        certificate verification behavior to not check server identity if
        set to 1. Only effective if "verify_SSL" is not set. Added in
        version 0.083.

    An accessor/mutator method exists for each attribute.

    Passing an explicit "undef" for "proxy", "http_proxy" or "https_proxy"
    will prevent getting the corresponding proxies from the environment.

    Errors during request execution will result in a pseudo-HTTP status code
    of 599 and a reason of "Internal Exception". The content field in the
    response will contain the text of the error.

    The "keep_alive" parameter enables a persistent connection, but only to
    a single destination scheme, host and port. If any connection-relevant
    attributes are modified via accessor, or if the process ID or thread ID
    change, the persistent connection will be dropped. If you want
    persistent connections across multiple destinations, use multiple
    HTTP::Tiny objects.

    See "TLS/SSL SUPPORT" for more on the "verify_SSL" and "SSL_options"
    attributes.

  get|head|put|post|patch|delete
        $response = $http->get($url);
        $response = $http->get($url, \%options);
        $response = $http->head($url);

    These methods are shorthand for calling request() for the given method.
    The URL must have unsafe characters escaped and international domain
    names encoded. See request() for valid options and a description of the
    response.

    The "success" field of the response will be true if the status code is
    2XX.

  post_form
        $response = $http->post_form($url, $form_data);
        $response = $http->post_form($url, $form_data, \%options);

    This method executes a "POST" request and sends the key/value pairs from
    a form data hash or array reference to the given URL with a
    "content-type" of "application/x-www-form-urlencoded". If data is
    provided as an array reference, the order is preserved; if provided as a
    hash reference, the terms are sorted by key for consistency. See
    documentation for the "www_form_urlencode" method for details on the
    encoding.

    The URL must have unsafe characters escaped and international domain
    names encoded. See request() for valid options and a description of the
    response. Any "content-type" header or content in the options hashref
    will be ignored.

    The "success" field of the response will be true if the status code is
    2XX.

  mirror
        $response = $http->mirror($url, $file, \%options)
        if ( $response->{success} ) {
            print "$file is up to date\n";
        }

    Executes a "GET" request for the URL and saves the response body to the
    file name provided. The URL must have unsafe characters escaped and
    international domain names encoded. If the file already exists, the
    request will include an "If-Modified-Since" header with the modification
    timestamp of the file. You may specify a different "If-Modified-Since"
    header yourself in the "$options->{headers}" hash.

    The "success" field of the response will be true if the status code is
    2XX or if the status code is 304 (unmodified).

    If the file was modified and the server response includes a properly
    formatted "Last-Modified" header, the file modification time will be
    updated accordingly.

  request
        $response = $http->request($method, $url);
        $response = $http->request($method, $url, \%options);

    Executes an HTTP request of the given method type ('GET', 'HEAD',
    'POST', 'PUT', etc.) on the given URL. The URL must have unsafe
    characters escaped and international domain names encoded.

    NOTE: Method names are case-sensitive per the HTTP/1.1 specification.
    Don't use "get" when you really want "GET". See LIMITATIONS for how this
    applies to redirection.

    If the URL includes a "user:password" stanza, they will be used for
    Basic-style authorization headers. (Authorization headers will not be
    included in a redirected request.) For example:

        $http->request('GET', 'http://Aladdin:open sesame@example.com/');

    If the "user:password" stanza contains reserved characters, they must be
    percent-escaped:

        $http->request('GET', 'http://john%40example.com:password@example.com/');

    A hashref of options may be appended to modify the request.

    Valid options are:

    *   "headers" â A hashref containing headers to include with the
        request. If the value for a header is an array reference, the header
        will be output multiple times with each value in the array. These
        headers over-write any default headers.

    *   "content" â A scalar to include as the body of the request OR a code
        reference that will be called iteratively to produce the body of the
        request

    *   "trailer_callback" â A code reference that will be called if it
        exists to provide a hashref of trailing headers (only used with
        chunked transfer-encoding)

    *   "data_callback" â A code reference that will be called for each
        chunks of the response body received.

    *   "peer" â Override host resolution and force all connections to go
        only to a specific peer address, regardless of the URL of the
        request. This will include any redirections! This options should be
        used with extreme caution (e.g. debugging or very special
        circumstances). It can be given as either a scalar or a code
        reference that will receive the hostname and whose response will be
        taken as the address.

    The "Host" header is generated from the URL in accordance with RFC 2616.
    It is a fatal error to specify "Host" in the "headers" option. Other
    headers may be ignored or overwritten if necessary for transport
    compliance.

    If the "content" option is a code reference, it will be called
    iteratively to provide the content body of the request. It should return
    the empty string or undef when the iterator is exhausted.

    If the "content" option is the empty string, no "content-type" or
    "content-length" headers will be generated.

    If the "data_callback" option is provided, it will be called iteratively
    until the entire response body is received. The first argument will be a
    string containing a chunk of the response body, the second argument will
    be the in-progress response hash reference, as described below. (This
    allows customizing the action of the callback based on the "status" or
    "headers" received prior to the content body.)

    Content data in the request/response is handled as "raw bytes". Any
    encoding/decoding (with associated headers) are the responsibility of
    the caller.

    The "request" method returns a hashref containing the response. The
    hashref will have the following keys:

    *   "success" â Boolean indicating whether the operation returned a 2XX
        status code

    *   "url" â URL that provided the response. This is the URL of the
        request unless there were redirections, in which case it is the last
        URL queried in a redirection chain

    *   "status" â The HTTP status code of the response

    *   "reason" â The response phrase returned by the server

    *   "content" â The body of the response. If the response does not have
        any content or if a data callback is provided to consume the
        response body, this will be the empty string

    *   "headers" â A hashref of header fields. All header field names will
        be normalized to be lower case. If a header is repeated, the value
        will be an arrayref; it will otherwise be a scalar string containing
        the value

    *   "protocol" - If this field exists, it is the protocol of the
        response such as HTTP/1.0 or HTTP/1.1

    *   "redirects" If this field exists, it is an arrayref of response hash
        references from redirects in the same order that redirections
        occurred. If it does not exist, then no redirections occurred.

    On an error during the execution of the request, the "status" field will
    contain 599, and the "content" field will contain the text of the error.

  www_form_urlencode
        $params = $http->www_form_urlencode( $data );
        $response = $http->get("http://example.com/query?$params");

    This method converts the key/value pairs from a data hash or array
    reference into a "x-www-form-urlencoded" string. The keys and values
    from the data reference will be UTF-8 encoded and escaped per RFC 3986.
    If a value is an array reference, the key will be repeated with each of
    the values of the array reference. If data is provided as a hash
    reference, the key/value pairs in the resulting string will be sorted by
    key and value for consistent ordering.

  can_ssl
        $ok         = HTTP::Tiny->can_ssl;
        ($ok, $why) = HTTP::Tiny->can_ssl;
        ($ok, $why) = $http->can_ssl;

    Indicates if SSL support is available. When called as a class object, it
    checks for the correct version of Net::SSLeay and IO::Socket::SSL. When
    called as an object methods, if "SSL_verify" is true or if
    "SSL_verify_mode" is set in "SSL_options", it checks that a CA file is
    available.

    In scalar context, returns a boolean indicating if SSL is available. In
    list context, returns the boolean and a (possibly multi-line) string of
    errors indicating why SSL isn't available.

  connected
        $host = $http->connected;
        ($host, $port) = $http->connected;

    Indicates if a connection to a peer is being kept alive, per the
    "keep_alive" option.

    In scalar context, returns the peer host and port, joined with a colon,
    or "undef" (if no peer is connected). In list context, returns the peer
    host and port or an empty list (if no peer is connected).

    Note: This method cannot reliably be used to discover whether the remote
    host has closed its end of the socket.

TLS/SSL SUPPORT
    Direct "https" connections are supported only if IO::Socket::SSL 1.56 or
    greater and Net::SSLeay 1.49 or greater are installed. An error will
    occur if new enough versions of these modules are not installed or if
    the TLS encryption fails. You can also use HTTP::Tiny::can_ssl() utility
    function that returns boolean to see if the required modules are
    installed.

    An "https" connection may be made via an "http" proxy that supports the
    CONNECT command (i.e. RFC 2817). You may not proxy "https" via a proxy
    that itself requires "https" to communicate.

    TLS/SSL provides two distinct capabilities:

    *   Encrypted communication channel

    *   Verification of server identity

    By default, HTTP::Tiny verifies server identity.

    This was changed in version 0.083 due to security concerns. The previous
    default behavior can be enabled by setting
    $ENV{PERL_HTTP_TINY_SSL_INSECURE_BY_DEFAULT} to 1.

    Verification is done by checking that that the TLS/SSL connection has a
    valid certificate corresponding to the host name of the connection and
    that the certificate has been verified by a CA. Assuming you trust the
    CA, this will protect against machine-in-the-middle attacks
    <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine-in-the-middle_attack>.

    Certificate verification requires a file or directory containing trusted
    CA certificates.

    IO::Socket::SSL::default_ca() is called to detect the default location
    of your CA certificates. This also supports the environment variables
    "SSL_CERT_FILE" and "SSL_CERT_DIR", and will fail over to Mozilla::CA if
    no certs are found.

    If IO::Socket::SSL::default_ca() is not able to find usable CA
    certificates, HTTP::Tiny will search several well-known system-specific
    default locations for a CA certificate file as a last resort:

    *   /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt

    *   /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt

    *   /etc/ssl/ca-bundle.pem

    *   /etc/openssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt

    *   /etc/ssl/cert.pem

    *   /usr/local/share/certs/ca-root-nss.crt

    *   /etc/pki/tls/cacert.pem

    *   /etc/certs/ca-certificates.crt

    An error will be occur if "verify_SSL" is true and no CA certificate
    file is available.

    If you desire complete control over TLS/SSL connections, the
    "SSL_options" attribute lets you provide a hash reference that will be
    passed through to IO::Socket::SSL::start_SSL(), overriding any options
    set by HTTP::Tiny. For example, to provide your own trusted CA file:

        SSL_options => {
            SSL_ca_file => $file_path,
        }

    The "SSL_options" attribute could also be used for such things as
    providing a client certificate for authentication to a server or
    controlling the choice of cipher used for the TLS/SSL connection. See
    IO::Socket::SSL documentation for details.

PROXY SUPPORT
    HTTP::Tiny can proxy both "http" and "https" requests. Only Basic proxy
    authorization is supported and it must be provided as part of the proxy
    URL: "http://user:pass@proxy.example.com/".

    HTTP::Tiny supports the following proxy environment variables:

    *   http_proxy or HTTP_PROXY

    *   https_proxy or HTTPS_PROXY

    *   all_proxy or ALL_PROXY

    If the "REQUEST_METHOD" environment variable is set, then this might be
    a CGI process and "HTTP_PROXY" would be set from the "Proxy:" header,
    which is a security risk. If "REQUEST_METHOD" is set, "HTTP_PROXY" (the
    upper case variant only) is ignored, but "CGI_HTTP_PROXY" is considered
    instead.

    Tunnelling "https" over an "http" proxy using the CONNECT method is
    supported. If your proxy uses "https" itself, you can not tunnel "https"
    over it.

    Be warned that proxying an "https" connection opens you to the risk of a
    man-in-the-middle attack by the proxy server.

    The "no_proxy" environment variable is supported in the format of a
    comma-separated list of domain extensions proxy should not be used for.

    Proxy arguments passed to "new" will override their corresponding
    environment variables.

LIMITATIONS
    HTTP::Tiny is *conditionally compliant* with the HTTP/1.1 specifications
    <http://www.w3.org/Protocols/>:

    *   "Message Syntax and Routing" [RFC7230]

    *   "Semantics and Content" [RFC7231]

    *   "Conditional Requests" [RFC7232]

    *   "Range Requests" [RFC7233]

    *   "Caching" [RFC7234]

    *   "Authentication" [RFC7235]

    It attempts to meet all "MUST" requirements of the specification, but
    does not implement all "SHOULD" requirements. (Note: it was developed
    against the earlier RFC 2616 specification and may not yet meet the
    revised RFC 7230-7235 spec.) Additionally, HTTP::Tiny supports the
    "PATCH" method of RFC 5789.

    Some particular limitations of note include:

    *   HTTP::Tiny focuses on correct transport. Users are responsible for
        ensuring that user-defined headers and content are compliant with
        the HTTP/1.1 specification.

    *   Users must ensure that URLs are properly escaped for unsafe
        characters and that international domain names are properly encoded
        to ASCII. See URI::Escape, URI::_punycode and Net::IDN::Encode.

    *   Redirection is very strict against the specification. Redirection is
        only automatic for response codes 301, 302, 307 and 308 if the
        request method is 'GET' or 'HEAD'. Response code 303 is always
        converted into a 'GET' redirection, as mandated by the
        specification. There is no automatic support for status 305 ("Use
        proxy") redirections.

    *   There is no provision for delaying a request body using an "Expect"
        header. Unexpected "1XX" responses are silently ignored as per the
        specification.

    *   Only 'chunked' "Transfer-Encoding" is supported.

    *   There is no support for a Request-URI of '*' for the 'OPTIONS'
        request.

    *   Headers mentioned in the RFCs and some other, well-known headers are
        generated with their canonical case. Other headers are sent in the
        case provided by the user. Except for control headers (which are
        sent first), headers are sent in arbitrary order.

    Despite the limitations listed above, HTTP::Tiny is considered
    feature-complete. New feature requests should be directed to
    HTTP::Tiny::UA.
