Previous maintainer: Hal Pomeranz <pomeranz@netcom.com>, 1994-1997 (original
author unknown).  Much of the code for &parse_line() (including the
primary regexp) from Joerk Behrends <jbehrends@multimediaproduzenten.de>.

Examples section another documentation provided by John Heidemann 
<johnh@ISI.EDU>

Bug reports, patches, and nagging provided by lots of folks -- thanks
everybody!  Special thanks to Michael Schwern <schwern@envirolink.org>
for assuring me that a &nested_quotewords() would be useful, and to 
Jeff Friedl <jfriedl@yahoo-inc.com> for telling me not to worry about
error-checking (sort of-- you had to be there).
